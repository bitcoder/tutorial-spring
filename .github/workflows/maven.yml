# This workflow will build a Java project with Maven, and cache/restore any dependencies to improve the workflow execution time
# For more information see: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven

# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.

# we can split the "Build and Test" step, in two or more steps, for compiling and running the tests for example
# the "target" goal on maven implicitly will download dependencies, build classes, run tests, and package classes
